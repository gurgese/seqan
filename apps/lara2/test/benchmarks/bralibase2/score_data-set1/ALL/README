All files are in tab - delimited format. With:
column 1: dataset identifier (ncRNAfamily-alnNN-alignmentmethod) 
column 2: accuracy values (SCI or SPS) 

File names indicate algorithm and parameters used (more details of
these are given in the supplementary materials of Gardner, Wilm & Washietl
(2005)). 

The *_rnaz.dat files contain SCI scores.
The *_baliscore.dat files contain SPS scores as calculated with bali_score.c
from Balibase.

The file "ALL_ave_perc_id_grouped_HML.dat" gives:
column 1: dataset identifier (ncRNAfamily-alnNN-alignmentmethod)
column 2: mean percent sequence identity - as calculated with alistat (part of
Sean Eddy's SQUID package).
column 3: the homology grouping: High (H), Medium (M) or Low (L).
NB. See erratum below.

NB. The Table 1 in Gardner, Wilm & Washietl (2005) does not include the SRP
scores. Please remove these before running your benchmarks! I.e.
unalias ls; ls -1 | awk '{print "grep -v SRP "$1" > "$1"_noSRP"}' >remove_SRP.sh; chmod +x remove_SRP.sh; ./remove_SRP.sh;

Erratum: Some of the pairwise sequence identities have been scrambled (due to
a combination of mis-formatting and alistat sensitivity to mis-formatted
alignments). An updated set of identities can be found in
"ALL_ave_perc_id_grouped_HML_recalculated.dat".  In order to reproduce the
results presented in our paper use "ALL_ave_perc_id_grouped_HML.dat" otherwise
use the update. Note that the comparison of alignment methods of our paper
remain valid - it is only the homology groups are affected by this error.
