**********************************************************************

lara computes a multiple sequence-structure RNA alignments based on 
advanced combinatorial optimization techniques. It uses a Lagrangian 
relaxation approach to perform all-against-all comparisons and feeds 
the popular T-Coffee sequence alignment program with provably (near-)
optimal pairwise structural alignments, which will then respect 
structural constraints while building the overall multiple alignment.

lara is a command line program, i.e. you have to start lara within a
shell.


Quick Start
==========

$ ./prepare.sh			(if you run lara for the first time)
$ ./lara -i sample/tRNA.aln10.fasta


Slowly but Surely
=================

Before you start aligning, make sure that you run prepare.sh,
i.e. execute:

$ ./prepare.sh

This makes sure that T-COFFEE will run properly.


The main command for running lara looks like:

./lara -i <input_file> [-s] [-w <output_file>] [-o <parameter_file>]


The only mandatory argument is the input file (provided via the "-i"
flag) containing (extended) fasta sequences. You do not have to
specify what input you are providing, lara automatically detects your
input.


"<input_file>"

Specifies the name of the fasta file holding the input sequences. The
input file must contain either fasta or extended fasta sequences.


"-s"

If the "-s" is provided, then only the MFE structure is taken as the
structural input. Without "-s" the base pair probability matrices are
used (the default setting).


"-w <output_file>"

Specifies the file where the output (i.e.,multiple alignment) should
be written to. The default value is stdout.


"-o <parameter_file>"

Specifies the parameter file. Some important parameters are listed in
the next section. The default value is "lara.params".


Sample Commands
===============

Given the sample files, a typical run of lara should be as simple as:

$ ./lara -i sample/tRNA.aln10.fasta

This commands specifies that lara should take the fasta sequences in
tRNA.aln10.fasta as its input, compute the corresponding base pair
probability matrices and write the computed alignment to stdout.

If you want to use single MFE structures alone instead of the base
pair probability matrices, execute

$ ./lara -i sample/tRNA.aln10.fasta -s


If you want to write the alignment to a file (e.g. "foo"), then the
following line will do the trick:

$ ./lara -i sample/tRNA.aln10.fasta -w foo


If you want to provide an alternative parameter file, simply type:

$ ./lara -i sample/tRNA.aln10.fasta -o foo.params


Parameter File
==============

For a detailed explanation of the various parameters see the
PARAMETERS file.
