The following parameters are supported by LaRA and can be set in the 
param file ("lara.params" by default).


noofiterations: 
Number of iterations that should be performed. The higher the number,
the longer the computation takes.


noofnondecreasingiterations:
Number of non-decreasing iterations: If the value of the Lagrangian
dual does not decrease within the specified number, the optimization
process is stopped and the best solution is written to the library
file.


my:
The stepsize within the subgradient procedure is given by the
following equation: 
	s = my*([upper bound]-[lower bound])/([no of subgradients])


generatorscore: 
Use the specified scoring matrix (has to be in RIBOSUM format) for
generating alignment edges.


larascore: 
Use the specified scoring matrix (has to be in RIBOSUM format) for
scoring the sequence part of the structural alignment.


generatorsuboptimality: 
Parameter for the generation of alignment edges. The higher the value
of 'generatorsuboptimality', the more alignment edges are created.


sequencescale: 
Specifies the contribution of the sequence scores (specified by the
larascore matrix) to the overall structural alignment.


laraGapOpen,laraGapExtend:
Specifies the gap costs for the structural alignment.


structurescoring:
Either
'LOGARITHMIC': score = log( p_{ij}/p_{min} )
'SCALING'    : score = <scalingfactor>


verbosesolver:
Either
1	: creates verbose output
0	: disables verbose output


tcoffee_location: 
If you want to use your own version of T-Coffee (instead of the one
that is provided by LaRA), then specify the T-Coffee location by this
parameter.
